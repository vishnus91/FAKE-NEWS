# FAKE-NEWS
The implication of Machine learning in fake news detection has been described along with the concept of Fake news detection in social media platform. The TF-IDF vectorization is a useful mechanism for the fake news detection process, thus it is an overall accumulation of knowledge about the implication of various applications of techniques such as the Django framework with python programming language in the aspect of fake news detection in social media. The importance of this process is also discussed to understand the actual integration of these processes. This paper provided information related to the application of fake news posted on job websites along with its risks and issues. Moreover, this chapter provides information related to application of fake news detection process along with different machine learning tools and languages involved in application development for detecting fake news. There are various machine learning tools like logistic regression, decision tree, KNN, Random Forest Classifier for which the application and the importance of implementation in any organizational infrastructure has been represented in this paper. The spreading of fake news has increased a lot in recent times and along with that the importance of implementation has increased. Therefore, it can be said that this paper has been beneficial for understanding relevant approaches in this context. Here in this research, this researcher presented a perfect application of regression for detecting the fake news in the news articles, social networking sites and multiple job portals. After that the researcher effectively evaluated the Django Frameworkâ€˜s application based on the Python programming language. The researcher has given some figures for proper idealization.
